Character Sheet Converter
=========================
Purpose of this software is to convert the fillable PDF 
roleplaying character sheets into XML format used by some apps.
Ideally, the conversion mappings can be created for many formats,
but currently only supported path is:

- D&D Beyond -> GameMaster 5E

If you need mappings for additional formats, please forward me
the sample files with enough data filled to satisfy the needs.

Installation
------------
You need node.js installed. To get it, go to https://nodejs.org/

When installed, run command:

    npm i -g ccconvert

Usage
-----
Usage: ccconvert [options] <file...>

Options:

    -V, --version  output the version number
    -f, --force    Overwrite existing files
    -h, --help     output usage information

Motivation
----------
Unfortunately D&D Beyond, regardless how great it is, does not yet
provide DM tools, such as initiative tracking & combat management,
so I am still relying on other tools such as GM5 to help me along.

This tool allows me to download character sheets from D&D Beyond
and import them to Game Master 5E for playing.
